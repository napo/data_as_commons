Course for the [GSSI](https://www.gssi.it/) - Gran Sasso Science Institute<br/>
An international PhD school and a center for advanced studies in physics, mathematics, computer science and social sciences.


## Data as a Commons
*June 12th - 15th 2023*
https://www.gssi.it/seminars/seminars-and-events-2023/item/22282-data-as-commons

### Course Description:
The course aims to explore the concept of data as a common resource that can be shared, reused, and collaboratively managed for the benefit of all. It is designed for students in the fields of computer science, social sciences, and related areas, with the aim of creating cross-disciplinary contamination and uniting knowledge.<br/>
The course will cover a range of topics, including open data, dataspace, civic hacking, and data visualization with the goal to delve into the importance of open data in promoting transparency and innovation, the impact of dataspace on data sharing and collaboration, and the role of civic hacking in promoting social change and citizen engagement.<br/>
In addition to theoretical knowledge, the course includes a hands-on data visualization lab in the final session.<br/>
This lab will enable participants to develop practical skills in creating value from data. By the end of the course, participants will have a deep understanding of the potential of data as a commons and the skills needed to create value from it.<br/>
